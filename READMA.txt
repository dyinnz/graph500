#### Graph500 README ####

Compile and Running Environment
1. gcc-4.9.3
2. Intel MPI (Version 5.1.3)
3. zsh
4  cmake-2.8 or latter

Compile Command
after checking the compile environment, follow the instructions below in order please:
1. ./mk.sh g
2. ./mk.sh

Running Command
./run.sh  : launch single process on single node
./mpirun.sh : lauch multiple processes on multi nodes according to the hostfile

NOTICE:
the ./mpirun.sh shell script run **28** MPI processes by default, and we run graph500 on 4 nodes of our cluster

Running Parameters:
-s N         Generate the graph which scale is N
-v 1 or 0    whether or not run validation. I suggest that do not run validation when scale is large, because it may a bit slow



#### ISC 2016-06-21 Graph500 Result ####
Below is our running parameters:

./mpirun -s 26 -v 0       : means that scale is 26 and skip validtion after BFS

SCALE: 26
the average BFS TIME: 168.144333ms
the average TEPS: 8.757238e+09

Result Result:
test.log    the raw running log of graph500, contain most information you may need, but it is a little messy
time.log    the "time" and "date" command output, record when the program run and how long the program run
root.log    the extracted log of test.log. Get it by running command "grep ROOT test.log". Containing the necessary information
